## What is this?
Pok&#233;mon Team Builder was built by Steph Bertram, Sung-Jin Ahn, and Peggy Wang for educational purposes as part of Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp.


## Installation
How to get this app up and running


## Usage
```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```


## Deliverables
- [ ] Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server.

- [ ] Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads.

- [ ]  Use at least 3 distinct [event listeners][event-listeners] (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity.

- [ ]  Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (`map`, `forEach`, `filter`, etc).

- [ ]  Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.


### Planning
- [ ] Plan out your features
- [ ] Develop user stories
- [ ] "As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that [ I can accomplish this goal ]."
- [ ] Features should not need you there to explain them to users
- [ ] Plan out the structure of your JSON requests


### MVP ASAP
- [ ] Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible.
- [ ] Pick an API and explore it early on to ensure it will work for your need

User will be able to:
- [ ] Filter through a list of Pokemon. ('select')
  - [ ] MVP: one filter with 3-5 ways to filter
- [ ] Select a Pokemon to display their profile ('click)
- [ ] Add a Pokemon to their team via drag and drop functionality (or submit button) ('drag' event on window)
- [ ] Fallback: Edit your team (patch request)
  
Stretch:
- [ ] Search bar
- [ ] Additional arrays of teams (a, b, wishlist, bench, etc)
- [ ] Cookies/ local storage to persist team for individual users
- [ ] additional/ more complex filtering capabilities


### Guidelines for Staying Organized
- [ ] Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need
- [ ] Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about
  building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can
  access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data
  displayed.
- [ ] Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.
- [ ] Continue building features one by one.
